# MCP Server Priority Implementation Plan

This document outlines the prioritized implementation plan for integrating MCP servers from the community into the MCP-Launchpad project. The plan is organized by category and priority level, based on usefulness, implementation complexity, and strategic value.

## Priority Levels

- **Priority 1**: Essential servers with high value, relatively low implementation complexity, and broad applicability
- **Priority 2**: Important servers with significant value but moderate complexity
- **Priority 3**: Specialized servers with specific use cases or higher implementation complexity
- **Priority 4**: Experimental or highly specialized servers with limited general applicability

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 3: Special Capabilities (Months 5-6)

Implement servers with specialized capabilities for specific domains.

#### Search & Data Extraction

- [ ] **Web Search** (Priority 1) - Web search capabilities
- [ ] **YouTube Transcript MCP** (Priority 2) - Access to YouTube video transcripts

#### Art & Culture

- [ ] **Manim MCP Server** (Priority 3) - Animation generation
- [ ] **Video Editing MCP** (Priority 2) - Video editing capabilities

#### Code Execution

- [ ] **Pydantic AI Run Python** (Priority 2) - Secure Python code execution

### Phase 4: Advanced & Experimental (Months 7+)

Focus on more experimental or complex servers.

#### Aggregators

- [ ] **MindsDB** (Priority 2) - Data connection and unification
- [ ] **Pipedream** (Priority 2) - API connections
- [ ] **WayStation AI MCP** (Priority 3) - App connections

#### Coding Agents

- [ ] **CodeMCP** (Priority 3) - Coding agent capabilities
