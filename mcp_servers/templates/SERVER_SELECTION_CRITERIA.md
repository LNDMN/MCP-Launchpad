# MCP Server Selection and Integration Criteria

This document outlines the criteria used to select MCP servers for integration into MCP-Launchpad and the process for prioritizing implementation.

## Selection Criteria

When selecting an MCP server for inclusion in MCP-Launchpad, we consider the following criteria:

### Primary Criteria

1. **Usefulness**: The server should provide significant value to AI agents and users
2. **Uniqueness**: The server should offer capabilities not already covered by existing implementations
3. **Maintainability**: The server should be well-documented and actively maintained
4. **Security**: The server should follow security best practices and not introduce vulnerabilities
5. **License Compatibility**: The server should have an open-source license compatible with our project

### Secondary Criteria

1. **Popularity**: Community interest and potential user base
2. **Complexity**: Ease of implementation and maintenance
3. **Integration Potential**: How well it works with other MCP servers
4. **Performance**: Resource efficiency and scalability
5. **Cross-platform**: Ability to run on multiple platforms

## Integration Phases

We follow a systematic approach to integrate servers:

### Phase 1: Discovery and Selection

1. **Identification**: Discover potential MCP servers from repositories, forums, or community recommendations
2. **Initial Assessment**: Evaluate against selection criteria
3. **Prioritization**: Rank servers based on criteria and community needs

### Phase 2: Planning

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Identify necessary adaptations to meet our standards
2. **Resource Allocation**: Determine time and effort required
3. **Timeline**: Establish implementation schedule
4. **Dependency Mapping**: Identify dependencies on other systems or libraries

### Phase 3: Implementation

1. **Setup**: Create basic structure following template
2. **Core Implementation**: Adapt existing code or develop from scratch
3. **Docker Integration**: Create containerized implementation
4. **Testing**: Develop comprehensive test suite
5. **Documentation**: Create README.md and AGENT_DOCS.md

### Phase 4: Review and Refinement

1. **Code Review**: Ensure code quality and standards compliance
2. **Security Audit**: Validate security practices
3. **Performance Testing**: Evaluate under various loads
4. **Documentation Review**: Ensure documentation completeness

### Phase 5: Release and Maintenance

1. **Integration**: Add to main catalog
2. **Announcement**: Inform community about new server
3. **Monitoring**: Track usage and issues
4. **Updates**: Maintain and update as needed

## Prioritization Matrix

We use the following matrix to prioritize server integration:

| Criterion | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted Score |
|-----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Usefulness | 5 | | |
| Uniqueness | 4 | | |
| Maintainability | 3 | | |
| Security | 5 | | |
| License Compatibility | 5 | | |
| Popularity | 2 | | |
| Complexity | 2 | | |
| Integration Potential | 3 | | |
| Performance | 2 | | |
| Cross-platform | 1 | | |
| **TOTAL** | | | |

Servers with higher total scores are prioritized for earlier implementation.

## Source Attribution and Licensing

All servers adapted from existing codebases must:

1. Properly attribute the original source
2. Comply with the original license
3. Include license information in the server directory
4. Note any significant modifications from the original

## Community Contributions

We welcome community contributions for server integrations. Contributors should:

1. Follow the templates and guidelines provided
2. Complete the implementation checklist
3. Provide thorough documentation
4. Include comprehensive tests

Community-contributed servers undergo the same review process as internally selected servers.
