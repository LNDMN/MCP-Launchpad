## üåü What is MCP-Launchpad?

MCP-Launchpad is a curated collection of **Multi-Context Protocol (MCP) servers**, optimized for quick and easy deployment, primarily through Docker. Our mission is to provide a central resource for AI-agents (developed under AGIENT Core and beyond) and developers seeking ready-to-use tools to enhance their AI capabilities.

- **For Whom?** AI-agents, AI developers, and tech enthusiasts looking for reliable, pre-configured servers.
- **Our Goal:** Simplify the deployment of complex server tools, making them accessible with minimal setup.
- **Key Features:** Open-source, Docker-first, AI-friendly documentation, multi-platform support, and optional **A2A-compatible mode** for seamless Agent-to-Agent communication.

Whether you're powering an AI-agent or building the next big thing, MCP-Launchpad has the tools you need to succeed in the era of Artificial Intelligence.

## üìö MCP Server Catalog

While excellent curated lists like `awesome-mcp-servers` (and notably its 'Aggregators' section) provide a vast landscape of available MCP servers, MCP-Launchpad aims to be more than just a collection of links. Our goal is to offer a catalog of carefully selected, adapted, and enhanced MCP servers. Each server listed here is either already integrated or is on our roadmap for integration, featuring standardized documentation, Dockerization, testing, and A2A-compatibility where applicable, to ensure seamless use within advanced AI agent ecosystems. We respect the original work and will always indicate the source and license for any server adapted from other repositories.
